###  NOTE:  This project was part of a required submission for college. While the skeleton of the project such as (neccasity of including the concepts covered, adding sound effects, making sure that the game contains enemies, character movement, basic background elements) came from the class project requirement, building on those features and bringing in the dynamics to make the game stand out was entirely my doing.
